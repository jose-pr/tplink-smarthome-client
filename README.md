A very basic client to control and get information from TP-Link Smarthome devices. It is written on Typescript.
Started when i wanted a simple way to get power readings and the actual time of the device at the same time from a HS300 to forward to a splunk server. 

Based on the work from: https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug

Initial TS Typings came from the return objects at: https://github.com/plasticrake/tplink-smarthome-api
